## Downloading and code structure

If you are **not** familiar with ```git```, the easiest way to download the code is to get one of the releases from this location ```https://github.com/BME-ITEST-Students/roomba/releases```.

Download and unpack the code somewhere on your computer. The unpacked folder contains a number of example files and documentation as well as the ```PD2030``` package. The ```PD2030``` package contains two sub-packages:

```
PD2030
|
- roomba
- maestro
```

You can place you own scripts in the top level folder (i.e., the folder containing ```PD2030```). If you know what you're doing, you can copy the ```PD2030``` package to any location on your computer, as long as you make sure that Python can import it.

## Installing from github using Git

```pip install git+https://github.com/BME-ITEST-Students/roomba.git#egg=roomba```

## Documentation

The documentation for the relevant parts of the ```PD2030``` package can be found in the ```documentation``` folder. This documentation is also available online: [Direct link to the student documentation](https://github.com/BME-ITEST-Students/roomba/blob/master/documentation/markdown/index.md). Note however, that the online documentation might not match your version of the package.
